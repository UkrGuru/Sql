# Insider Info About the New Results Class in Benchmark

The world of performance benchmarking is always evolving, and recent updates to the `Sql` repository by UkrGuru have introduced an exciting new `Results` class in the `BenchResults` namespace. This article dives into the details of this new implementation, comparing it to its predecessor, and showcasing the performance improvements it brings to the table. Let’s explore what’s under the hood, based on the latest insights from the [Program.cs file](https://github.com/UkrGuru/Sql/blob/main/benchmark/BenchResults/ResultsNew.cs) in the benchmark suite.

## Benchmark Setup

The benchmarks were run using **BenchmarkDotNet v0.14.0** on the following system:

- **OS**: Windows 11 (10.0.26100.3194)  
- **CPU**: 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700K (1 CPU, 20 logical and 12 physical cores)  
- **.NET SDK**: 9.0.200  
- **Runtime**: .NET 9.0.2 (9.0.225.6610), X64 RyuJIT AVX2 [AttachedDebugger]  
- **Job**: ShortRun (IterationCount=3, LaunchCount=1, WarmupCount=3)  

This setup ensures a modern, high-performance environment to test the new `Results` class against the older `ParseOld` implementation.

## The Results: Old vs. New

The benchmark compares two methods: `ParseOld_40_results` (the legacy approach) and `ResultsNew_40_results` (the new implementation). Here’s how they stack up:

| Method                | Mean     | Error     | StdDev    | Gen0   | Allocated |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ParseOld_40_results   | 2.056 μs | 0.1926 μs | 0.0106 μs | 0.1450 |   1.86 KB |
| ResultsNew_40_results | 1.056 μs | 0.0520 μs | 0.0028 μs | 0.0973 |   1.25 KB |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Performance Boost**:  
   The new `ResultsNew_40_results` method clocks in at a mean execution time of **1.056 microseconds**, a remarkable improvement over the older `ParseOld_40_results` method’s **2.056 microseconds**. That’s nearly a **50% reduction** in execution time!

2. **Stability**:  
   The new implementation shows significantly lower variability, with an error of **0.0520 μs** and a standard deviation of **0.0028 μs**, compared to **0.1926 μs** and **0.0106 μs** for the old method. This suggests the new class is not only faster but also more consistent.

3. **Memory Efficiency**:  
   Memory usage sees a notable improvement as well. The `ResultsNew_40_results` method allocates just **1.25 KB** with a Gen0 collection rate of **0.0973**, down from **1.86 KB** and **0.1450** in the old method. This reduction in memory footprint could be a game-changer for large-scale applications.

## What’s Driving the Improvement?

While the exact implementation details of the `Results` class aren’t fully exposed in the benchmark file, the numbers hint at some clever optimizations. Likely candidates include:

- **Optimized Parsing Logic**: The new class may employ a more efficient algorithm for handling the 40 results, reducing computational overhead.
- **Reduced Object Overhead**: The drop in memory allocation suggests fewer temporary objects or a more streamlined data structure.
- **Better Use of .NET 9 Features**: Running on .NET 9.0.2 with RyuJIT AVX2, the new class might leverage modern runtime enhancements for better performance.

## Why It Matters

For developers working with the `Sql` library, this upgrade could mean faster query result processing and lower resource consumption—crucial for high-performance applications. Whether you’re building a data-intensive service or optimizing an existing system, the new `Results` class offers a compelling reason to update.

## Conclusion

The introduction of the `Results` class in UkrGuru’s `Sql` repository marks a significant leap forward in performance and efficiency. With a near 50% reduction in execution time, improved stability, and a lighter memory footprint, it’s clear that this isn’t just a minor tweak—it’s a reimagining of how results are handled. Keep an eye on this project as it continues to evolve, and consider integrating these improvements into your own workflows.
